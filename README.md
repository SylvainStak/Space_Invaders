# [GAME NOT COMPLETED YET]
* When the TO-DO List is empty then I will delete this warning as the game will be completed

# Space Invaders
This is a simplified version of Space Invaders written in Python using the PyGame module

# Requirements
To be able to run this you need Python 3.2 or newer and PyGame 1.9.6 or newer

# How to Play
Just clone this repository by using:
<strong>git clone https://github.com/SylvainStak/Space_Invaders.git</strong>

Once you enter the folder of the game, type: "<strong>python main.py</strong>", and a window should appear so you can play

# Controls are:
* Move left: <-- Left arrow
* Move right: --> Right arrow
* Shoot: X (x)

Either win or loose, at the end of the round it will show up a small window with the final results "Win" or "Loose" and the number of bullets fired in that particular round

# TO-DO
* Add Joystick control (I will implement this when everything is done, dont you think it would be funny to play this with a joystick?)
* Check for Wins
